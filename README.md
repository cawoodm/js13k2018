## Plot
The internet DIED!
Everyone is OFFLINE!!
But they still need their PIZZA!!!
As the only PSYCHIC in town, only you can save them.
Divine the customer.
Take their order.
Deliver the pizza.
Keep the market share.

## Controls
Arrow keys (or WASD) to move.
Drive to a customer and press [spacebar] to take an order.
Return to the pizzeria and wait for the pizzas.
Refueling is automatic at the pizzeria.
Return to the customer and press [spacebar] to deliver the order (and earn $20).
Watch your fuel - 0 means gameover.
Watch your customer satisfaction: more lost customers than happy or satisfied customers is also gameover.

## Strategy
Clients close by are more impatient - but you use less fuel getting to them.
Faraway clients are much more patient, you need more fuel but can combine orders better.
